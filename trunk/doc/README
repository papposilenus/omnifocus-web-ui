INSTALLATION
============
1. Copy this directory to some place that you can easily find (i.e., your home directory)
2. Open the "Terminal" application (found under Applications/Utilities standard in OS X)
3. Within the terminal, type "cd omnifocus-ui_0_1_1"
4. Within the terminal, type "ruby script/server"
4a. If you are on OS X >= 10.5, give Ruby permission to respond to incoming network traffic.
5. In your Safari web browser (on your Mac!), go to http://localhost:3000
5a. If the web server is running, you should see an iPhone-like interface listing your contexts and your action counts per context.

Additional installation for use behind router
=============================================
6. Set up port forwarding to forward incoming requests against port 3000 to your Mac running OmniFocus
6a. Bring up System Preferences => Network
6b. Write down the value of the "IP Address" field
6c. Log in to your router and set up port forwarding for port 3000 to forward TCP traffic to the IP Address recorded in 5b.  Refer to the instructions for your particular router as necessary.
7. Set up Dynamic DNS to refer to your _EXTERNAL_ IP address
7a. Log into your router, locate the _EXTERNAL_ IP address of your router assigned by your Internet Service Provider.  This address will _NOT_ begin with a 10.* or 192.*!!
7b. Go to https://www.dyndns.com/account/create.html to create a FREE account with DynDNS
7c. Once you have an account, on the DynDNS page, go to the "Account" page
7d. From the "Account" page, go to "Add Host Services" (https://www.dyndns.com/account/services/hosts/add.html).  You will be presented with a form requesting a name and IP address among other fields.  ONLY ENTER DATA IN THE FIELDS SPECIFIED IN THESE INSTRUCTIONS!
7e. For the "Hostname" field, pick a name that you can remember.  You may also select a domain name in the pick list to go with it.  This will form an address like <hostname>.<name from pick list>
7f. In the "IP Address" field, enter the information that you collected from step 7a.
7g. Click the "Create Host" button.
7h. Wait a few minutes and then directo your browser to the <hostname>.<name from pick list> address.  
7i. If 7h was successful, try to direct your iPhone to the same address.
7j. BOOKMARK the address in your iPhone for ease of use (which is the WHOLE REASON for using Dynamic DNS)
