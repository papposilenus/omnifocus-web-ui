<h2>Dealing with problem applications</h2>

<p>Appscript provides a number of mechanisms for dealing with problematic applications. See the <a href="http://rb-appscript.rubyforge.org">appscript website</a> for more information.</p>


<h2>Security issues</h2>

<p>If including user names and/or passwords in remote application URLs, please note that appscript retains these URLs in both the <code>Terminology</code> module's internal cache and in the Application and Reference objects subsequently created from those URLs. Security here is the user's responsibility, as it's their code that creates and retains these objects.</p>


<h2>GUI Scripting</h2>

<p>Non-scriptable applications may in some cases be controlled from Ruby by using System Events to manipulate their graphical user interface. Note that the &quot;Enable access for assistive devices&quot; checkbox must be selected in the Universal Access system preferences pane for GUI Scripting to work.</p>


<h2>AEDescs</h2>

<p>Some applications (e.g. QuarkXpress) may return values which appscript cannot convert to equivalent Ruby types. These values are usually of types which are defined, used and understood only by that particular application, and will be represented in Ruby as raw <code>AE::AEDesc</code> objects (e.g. <code>#&lt;AE::AEDesc:0x33fc40&gt;</code>). While there's not much you can do with raw <code>AEDesc</code> objects within Ruby (it's best just to treat them as opaque types), subsequent commands can pass them back to the application for further use and/or conversion just like any other value.</p>

<!--
<h2>aemcodegen</h2>

<p>The <code>appscript.tools.aemcodegen</code> module is an convenience tool for translating appscript commands into their aem equivalents; useful if you want to control applications using the lower-level aem package. See the <code>aemcodegen</code> module's docstring for more information.</p>
-->

<h2>Appscript and threads</h2>

<p>When using appscript in multi-threaded systems, always send application commands from the main thread. (This is a limitation of the underlying aem package, which currently doesn't support receiving reply events on non-main threads.)</p>
